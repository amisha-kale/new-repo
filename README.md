# Netflix-Watch TV

![DemoGif](flixdemo.gif)

A Netflix clone We created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* Redux Toolkit 
* Context API 
* Responsive web design 


<br />

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the 
code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

<br />

* Integration with DotNet Backend for Authentication and Profile Management.

* Frontend Developer - Shrey Pathak and Soumokanti Bera.
